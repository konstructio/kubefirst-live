We have a [biweekly livestream](https://www.youtube.com/@kubefirst) named Kubefirst Live, where we are discussing not only kubefirst but anything cloud native.

Here are some guidelines for our guests.

## Guidelines

Firstly, we want you to have fun! It's important for us that you have a good time, and let's be honest, if you do, our viewers will too: it will translate in a better experience for everyone. With that said, here's some guidelines or things to keep in mind to help you get the best out of your livestream with us.

### Goal

The goal of the livestream is simple: we want to create valuable, fun, and educational content for our community. Whether it means sharing about the cool new features of our platform, or someone's else, it's all about helping developers, DevOps, and GitOps practitioners be successful. It's that simple!

### Ambiance

If you don't know us much yet, we are a bunch of happy people doing something we love. We are tackling serious problems in the cloud native space, without taking ourselves seriously. Kubefirst Live is no different: we are laid back. Do not stress out, it will be a fun discussion between friends. Demos may go wrong; that's OK. Internet connections may be flaky: that's OK. You may forget to say something important: that's OK. That's real life, so again, let's have fun, and things will be good.

### Format

We will discuss together the format of the livestream, but as a suggestion, here's the simple, but effective schedule we like when it's about showcasing your product:

- We are introducing the livestream, and everyone introduce themselves.
- You tell us about your product: what is it, what does it do, why should one use it, why do our community should care: it's the time to be shameless.
- This is the point where we jump into demonstration mode. We will install your software, tool or service on a cluster created with kubefirst. With everything working live, we can showcase what you just talked about.
- We conclude the livestream with some ways to get in touch with us. It's also the perfect moment for any last words.

We try to keep those on the 30-45 minutes length, but we are not policing time: as long as we have interesting content to share or discussion to have, we're good.

### Preparations

Once we agree on a date, we will send you two meetings request: one for the livestream, which will be booked for one hour and a half, so you don't have to rush to another meeting right after. Yes, we are that friendly. We will also send you a pre-show meeting, which is 15 minutes before, so we ensure everything is working video, and sound-wise, but any last-minute discussion. If you want, we can also schedule a 30 minutes a day or two before to discuss more in detail the flow of the show, but we try not to do any dry run to keep it natural, but we will be happy to schedule one if it makes you at ease.

You do not have to learn how kubefirst is working as we will take care of making work your product on our platform, and will let you know if we have any issues or questions. Still, it would be a good idea to [learn a little about our platform](https://docs.kubefirst.io) before the show. What you need to prepare is some slides, if you need them, for the part where you'll share about your product (see the [Format section](#format) for more information on that). The week of the livestream, we'll share with you the slides we'll use (we use Google Slides, so you'll need a Google account to edit them), in which you'll have a section to add yours. If you prefer, you can use your own slides: no worries, we'll just switch the screen to yours once it's your turn.

### Platform

We use [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) as our livestream platform. The platform will stream the show on Kubefirst [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kubefirst), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubefirst) account, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kubefirst/) page, [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kubefirst) channel, and on [Kubeshop YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thekubeshop) (our parent company). You'll receive the link a couple of days before the livestream: you should open it to test everything is working. You'll need to give permission access to your webcam and microphone.

All [you need](https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612-Guest-instructions) is a modern browser, with a proper internet connection, a microphone, webcam, and headphones. We highly suggest you use headphones/earphones so there's no echo happening due to the microphone picking audio from the livestream.

When asked to enter your name: you can either add your full name or just your first one, whatever floats your boat. We only ask that if you are using Twitter, to add ` | @username` after your name. Lastly, be sure that in `Settings` > `Camera`, the `Camera resolution` combobox has `Full High Definition (1080p)` selected, for best video quality.

### Promotion

A couple of days before the stream, we will share on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kubefirst), [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kubefirst/), [Slack community](https://kubefirst.io/slack), and in other related communities. We will tag your company. To help us spread the words, a retweet and reshare with your company's social media or even your personal ones are more than welcome.
